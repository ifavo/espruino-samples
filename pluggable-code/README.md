allows you to update code running on an espruino without connecting it to a computer just by changing the SD card.

the example shows a file `app.js` which should be on an SD card.  
the `main.js` should be the code running on the espruiono.  

for an update:
* insert the SD card with the new code into the espruino
* hit the reset button
* voila!
